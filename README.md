Pandas Challenge - School Summary

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district, I am thrilled to embark on the crucial task of analyzing district-wide standardized test results to inform strategic decisions on future school budgets and priorities. Armed with comprehensive data on each student's math and reading scores, along with additional school-related information, my objective is to aggregate and present key trends in school performance.

In establishing the foundation for this analysis, I have created a dedicated repository named "pandas-challenge" and set up a folder within it called "PyCitySchools." The main analysis script, a Jupyter notebook, has been added to this folder and pushed to the repository on GitHub or GitLab.

The report will encompass a comprehensive District Summary, providing a high-level snapshot of key metrics, such as the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects combined. Additionally, a School Summary will be generated, detailing key metrics for each school, including school type, total students, total school budget, per-student budget, and performance statistics.

The analysis will further highlight the highest-performing and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing percentages. Math and reading scores by grade level will be presented, offering insights into the performance of students in each grade at each school.

To provide a nuanced understanding of school performance, I will break down the data based on school spending ranges per student and school size. By employing appropriate bins and labels, I will calculate and present average scores and passing percentages for each category. Finally, the report will culminate with an analysis of school performance based on school type.

Throughout this analysis, I aim to uncover actionable insights that will guide strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing to the continuous improvement of our city's education system.
